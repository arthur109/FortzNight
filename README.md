# FortzNight
a classy little game that is not related in any way to fortnight, It was just named that way just in case people miss type fortnight. This a 2 player game and you can check it out right here https://arthur109.github.io/FortzNight/

## How to play
Its pretty simple, kill the other player. Right now there arent the full game mechanics, but you can place a turret by pressing "c" and then clicking where you want to place it. you can also collect ammo (but right now the utrrets dont use ammo) and place blocks by pressing the down key.
